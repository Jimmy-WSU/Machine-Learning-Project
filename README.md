In the stock market, trading is high frequency. It is hard to detect or predict the trend of the future stock market. Plenty of researchers and investors have done plenty of studies on stock market prediction, put forward many theories, and hypotheses try to find a relatively accurate predicting method. Therefore, we want to do some investment and try to find an appropriate method to predict the stock market. First, we will calculate the moving average of each company. Use this value to predict the future stock value. Then, we start to predict its value, we will have to take machine learning or deep learning methods into use. Nowadays, there are two popular methods which are the LSTM model and the XGBoost model for predicting stock value. In this paper, we are going to find a low-risk company, then, we are trying to find out which method has a high mimic to the future price of this company.
